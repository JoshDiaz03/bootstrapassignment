# bootstrapassignment
Used bootstrap to create a navigation bar and a hamburger menu on reduced size screens.

Created a form using bootsrap. used a grid column to place first and last name side by side. included text areas for email, password and comments. 
Placed a required attribute for email, password and check box.

Created table with a table-responsive in order to create a scroll when screen size is reduced. Hard coded submissions of first and last name.
Email, password and position. centered aligned text, added striped rows and a hover over the rows.

Added two images, I placed both images in a img-fluid to create responsiveness. Placed first image in a fuild-container.

Added two buttons. Second button added a d-none, d-xl-block to hide button on smaller screens.
